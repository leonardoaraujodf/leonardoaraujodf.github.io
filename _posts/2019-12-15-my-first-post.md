Hello guys, my name is Leonardo Amorim, I'm a Electronic Engineer from University of Brasilia, Brazil. This blog was made to show you some cool stuff that I've learned when I was in the university and I'm actually working right now. 

My main goal is to create some posts about microcontrollers, vhdl, fpgas, embedded systems and so on, cause it is the subset that I like most. This could help some people with the same problems that I've been when I was working with those things. Feel free to contact me and enjoy! See your later 8-)
