Electronics engineering student at University of Brasilia and also electrotechnician. I have experience developing projects with microcontrollers, like MSP430, STM32F407VG (ARM Cortex-M4) and the DSP TMS320F28335. I'm also experienced with Linux System, working with the Raspberry Pi 3, Python and C++ . Actually, I have been working with VHDL for FPGAs in a team which is developing an SDR for the DVB-S2X and DVB-RCS2 standards.
